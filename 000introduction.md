# Introduction
Dear reader, this is just a fan translation. Made in good faith by an enjoyer of the German version of Ilaris.
You might encounter bad wordings, ambiguities and plain wrongness in this translation.
That's probably because of me - the translator - and not because of the real content.

Also, I have taken the freedome to interpret passages that are ambigue in the original Ilaris book. Therefore, my interpretations might differ from the true intend the author had.
However, this is only done in cases where interpretation was necessary to produce clearly understandable text.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue: https://github.com/XaverStiensmeier/ilarisEnglishMarkdown
I hope you enjoy reading and playing Ilaris.

## Original Introduction
Hardly any other game world is as colourful, multi-layered and rich in detail as Aventuria.
I dived into role-playing for the first time in Aventuria and since then the continent between Riva and the Forest Islands never let me go. But this
fascinating game world is contrasted with a system that many take a critical view of: "You play DSA for the background, not for the rules."
I think that's a pity. Because a fascinating game world deserves a fascinating system.

This system has to be fast and efficient, so that the role play takes centre stage. This system must offer uniform rules from a single source, so that it is as
as simple as possible. And this system must offer choices by which you - and no one else - are able to decide the end of the story. Ilaris is my attempt to write this system.

Ilaris combines all the important rules for role-playing in Aventuria in one book. That we have made it this far at all, is thanks to the many supporters, who have helped me over the last four years.
It is only thanks to their help, criticism and enthusiasm that we are now able to hold this book in our hands. I hope that Ilaris radiates this enthusiasm and can fascinate you, too. Experience Aventuria anew!

### What do I need to play Ilaris?
You do not need to know the original rules of the Black Eye to play Ilaris. However, you - or someone in  your gaming group - should have already played a tabletop and know the game world of Aventuria.
This book contains very little information on these topics.

More about Aventuria can be found in the Aventurian Almanac or in the free game help "Welcome to Aventuria" which is only available in German.

Otherwise, all you need is this book, some six- and twenty-sided dice, pen and pencil - and of course imagination and curiosity!
imagination and curiosity!
