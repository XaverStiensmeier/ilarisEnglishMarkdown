# Characters
*Valeria had always loved the gardens, far away from the hustle and the stench of the city below, and the boredom in the marble villas. Slowly, the silence brought calmness to her racing thoughts as she stumbled. She felt a gust of air as the bolt grazed her left ear and embedded itself into the pavilion in front of her. This time, she didn't turn around but ran. She pushed aside a palm leaf, leaped over an intricately designed watercourse, and landed on the peacock shelter. Hopefully, the assassin hadn't loaded another crossbow! She grabbed the top edge of the garden wall, pulled herself up, and lowered herself onto the other side onto the street. The guards rushed towards her from the entrance gate, so they were bought off too! While her pursuer scaled the wall almost silently, she made a sharp turn and stormed down the street.*

At the center of your adventures are the player characters, who shape the shared story with their strengths and weaknesses.

You can choose your player character either from our collection of pre-made archetypes (within [Sephrasto](https://github.com/Aeolitus/Sephrasto)) and start playing right away, or you can generate a character according to your own vision. For the latter option, you'll find a four-step guide in the first part of this chapter, illustrated with an example character generation.

Throughout the process, you'll come across references to later parts of the chapter, where you'll find all the unique characteristics, skills, and advantages that make your character truly special. The background section describes the character's traits and status, while the attributes, skills, and advantages cover the character's values.

Now you can get started - the adventure awaits!

## Generation
Here you will learn how to generate your character - and how to further develop them later on, as in Ilaris there is no distinction between character generation and later advancement.

It all starts with an idea: What kind of character do you want to play? A shining hero, a dark villain, or something in between? Do you want them to excel in combat, be able to cast spells or liturgies, or rely on their silver tongue? Have they lived a life of privilege or struggled to make ends meet? If you're unsure, you can also consult with your fellow players - they might be able to assist you.

*Judith wants to play a character knowledgeable about nature, capable of defending themselves but lacking understanding of the laws of civilization. As for their origin, she is initially unsure, but since the group is going to experience adventures in South Aventuria, she decides to create a tribal warrior of the Mohas. Her character will be named Isna-Iti.*

### Step 1: Choosing Aspects
Aspects describe the strengths and weaknesses of your character, their background, education, and worldview. They shape the stories you will experience and are at the beginning of every character generation process.

At the start of the game, you should choose around **four aspects**. These aspects should include both strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, they should not be too specific or too general. You can find more tips on choosing your aspects and some examples [here]().

*For Judith's tribal warrior, she wants her to be superstitious but also particularly empathetic. Therefore, she chooses the aspect "I hear the whispers of the Nipakau..." Additionally, Isna-Iti gets the aspect "Tools? I can manage without them" and "Hello, Queen." After her initial sessions, Judith plans to add more aspects to give Isna-Iti even more depth.*

#### Developing Aspects
Dangers and obstacles, successes and encounters will shape and change your character. That's why your aspects will also evolve. After an adventure, you can, in consultation with the Game Master, remove or modify aspects. For example, the aspect "In service of the Ban Ray" could change to "Disgracefully discharged Ban Ray member." If your character has fewer than eight aspects, you can also add aspects in consultation with the Game Master. Such changes reflect profound transformations of your character and should be rare.

### Step 2: Choose Status
The status determines whether your character has dined on quail eggs in their previous life or has just escaped from inhumane slave labor in a mine. The status is divided into five levels, and you must choose one: **Elite**, **Upper Class**, **Middle Class**, **Lower Class**, and **Scum**. This decision primarily affects your character's background rather than their values, so choose the status that aligns with your character concept! More details [here]().

*For the forest people, status doesn't play a significant role, but in the civilized world, Isna-Iti wouldn't enjoy much prestige. Therefore, Judith chooses the status of Lower Class.*

#### Changing Status
Of course, during the course of your adventurer's life, your character's status can also change. They could be ennobled or become wealthy through valuable loot, thereby **improving their status**. Conversely, their actions could tarnish their reputation or they could lose their wealth or even their freedom, resulting in a **decrease in status**. Like aspects, status should change relatively slowly.

### Step 3: Distributing Points
Experience Points (EP) are the currency with which you develop the values of your character, enabling them to overcome increasingly greater challenges.

#### How many experience points do I have?
Before the generation process, you should collectively decide how powerful you want your characters to be at the start of the game. Choose an appropriate experience level from the table below, and then assign yourself the corresponding experience points as your starting capital. For beginners, we recommend starting with inexperienced novices and gradually developing the characters from there.

|Classification of Experience Points|^ |
|:----------------------:|:----------:|
| Inexperienced Novice    | 3000 EP        |
| Promising Young Hero     | 3000 EP      | 
| Competent Adventurer        | 4000 EP      | 
| Respected Veteran       | 6000 EP      |
| Famous Hero       | 8000 EP      |

*The players in Judith's group want to experience the full development from ordinary adventurers to exceptional heroes. Therefore, they decide to start with inexperienced newcomers, each having 2000 EP.*

Additional experience points are awarded by the Game Master as rewards for successfully completing adventures or, in the case of very long adventures, after completing a section of the adventure. As a guideline, 20-40 experience points are typically awarded for a game session of about four hours. The actual amount of experience points received does not depend on the level of success achieved. For example, if the characters' hometown was just burned down, the players should not be further penalized by deducting experience points.

The accumulated experience points form a balance that you can save for later use, such as purchasing an expensive advantage. Any remaining experience points never expire. However, you cannot go into negative balance; you cannot "borrow" the missing 2 experience points for an advantage. How you spend the accumulated experience points is entirely up to you.

#### Where do I start?
With experience points, you can purchase [attributes](), [skill values](), and [advantages]() - we will introduce all these options briefly in the following sections. To help you stay organized, we recommend the following order:

1. First, choose the advantages that your character absolutely should have. Many of these advantages require specific attributes.
2. Increase the attributes that you need for your desired advantages. Allocate the remaining points to the other attributes, following your intuition, until you have used up a little more than half of your experience points - spellcasters and clerics use slightly less than half.
3. Distribute the remaining experience points among skill values, talents, free skills, and potentially supernatural abilities. Experiment with different options to see what you like best!

> **What do experience points represent?**<br>
> EP are a rough measure of your character's abilities and a reward for you to improve your character.<br>
> They cannot and should not simulate the real learning of an adventurer. Therefore, there are no EP for months of studying in libraries, and the costs of all abilities are based on their usefulness, not on how difficult they are to learn.<br>
>**Experience points for Non-Player Characters?**<br>
> Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in Ilaris follow the same character rules as player characters, meaning they need to fulfill the requirements of advantages, for example.
> However, in most cases, it will be sufficient to estimate the values of NPCs based on their intended role in the game world. If a special NPC requires generation, the Game Master determines how many EP the NPC receives: A squire of a player knight may only need 2000 EP, while a warlord in the Wilderlands surely deserves 6000 EP.<br>
>**Optional: Simulationist Character Generation**<br>
>The character system of Ilaris aims to create equally valuable characters who can each contribute their strengths to the game and shine in the spotlight
>However, this does not necessarily reflect the reality of Aventuria. In Aventuria, training often depends on time and money, so knights, guild mages, dwarves, and others receive excellent education in many areas, while a beggar can only acquire a few things through experience. Simulationist character generation takes this into account.
>Characters with excellent education, such as warriors, knights, guild mages, elves, many dwarves, many initiates, or students of special mentors, receive 200-400 EP more, which they can primarily use to acquire additional skills and (supernatural) talents. On the other hand, characters disadvantaged by fate start with a starting capital 200 EP lower.<br>
>**Optional: Genre-Specific Experience Points**<br>
> EP serve as motivation for players to engage in adventures. However, in thematic groups, EP can also reward other genre-specific actions.
>1. The schemers at the imperial court of the Middle Kingdom could receive 20 bonus EP if they maneuver an ally into a position of influence or weave a particularly well-thought-out intrigue—even if they ultimately fail.
>2. In a swashbuckling game, a spectacular duel on a rooftop could be rewarded with 10 bonus EP.
>This can provide an additional incentive to engage in genre-specific behavior. We recommend discussing such rewards in advance and always giving the bonus EP to all players.

##### 1. Advantages
Advantages are special abilities that can benefit your character in the game. 
You can acquire them **during character generation or later in the game**. Therefore, it's not a problem if you're not familiar with all the advantages right now. 
You can find a list of possible advantages [here](). However, they are also neatly listed in [Sephrasto](https://github.com/Aeolitus/Sephrasto), the character generation tool.

Advantages are acquired "all at once". Either your character possesses an advantage, or they do not. 
Depending on their power and versatility, advantages **cost 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100 experience points**, and sometimes have specific requirements.

*Judith likes the idea of two weapons and wants Isna-Iti to master the Dual-Wielding style, preferably at Levels I and II. This requires an Agility of 6, which she needs to keep in mind for the next step. 
She deducts 60 EP from her available EP (20 for Dual-Wielding I and 40 for Dual-Wielding II). She has 1940 EP remaining.<br>
Additionally, Judith wants Isna-Iti to be able to create useful items without many tools, which is why she considers the Improvisation advantage. However, it requires a Dexterity of 8, which is too costly for an inexperienced novice. 
With a heavy heart, Judith decides to forgo the advantage and plans to purchase it after the first adventures.*

##### 2. Attributes
Attributes represent the mental and physical foundation of your character. In Ilaris, there are eight attributes: Charisma, Intuition, Intelligence, Courage, Dexterity, Agility, Constitution, and Strength.
They are described in more detail [here](). Your attributes should range from 0 to 12: 0 is barely a socially acceptable attribute, **3 is average**, 6 is very good, 9 is outstanding, and a character with an attribute of 12 
belongs to a small circle of unique individuals - although higher attributes are possible. An inexperienced novice should start the game with attributes between 0 and 6.
Attributes are increased point by point. Each point costs the **target value x16** experience points.

*First, Judith increases Isna-Iti's Agility to 6 in order to meet the requirements for Dual Wield II.
She pays 16 EP (1 x 16) for the first point, 32 EP (2 x 16) for the second, 48 EP (3 x 16) for the third, and so on. In total, she spends 336 EP on Agility.
She also wants Isna-Iti to have good Dexterity, so Judith increases it to 4, paying 160 EP (16 + 32 + 48 + 64) for that.
For the remaining attributes, Judith relies on her intuition. 
She increases Isna-Iti's Constitution to 4 (160 EP), Courage to 3 (96 EP), Strength to 2 (48 EP), Intuition to 4 (160 EP), Intelligence to 2 (48 EP), and Charisma to 1 (16 EP).
In total, Judith has spent 1024 EP on attributes, which is slightly more than half of her points.*

##### 3. Skill Values and Talents
Skills are learned abilities, such as Athletics, Magic Lore, or Healing. You can find all skills and their descriptions starting from [here]().

When making skill checks, the **skill value** is one of the determining factors. Skill values are increased point by point, just like attributes, and each point costs the **target value x advancement factor** in experience points. The advancement factor depends on the skill and ranges from 2 to 4. The skill value cannot exceed the **highest** attribute involved in the **skill +2**. You can find information about which attributes are involved in a skill and their advancement factors starting from [here]().

*Judith first increases her skill value in Impact Weapons to 6. Impact Weapons has an advancement factor of 4, so she must spend a total of 84 EP (4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 20 + 24) for this. She then raises her skill value in Stealth to 5, which - with an advancement factor of 3 - costs a total of 45 EP (3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15). Additionally, she increases several other skill values, such as Polearms to 6, Survival to 5, and Craftsmanship to 5. In total, she spends 338 EP on her skill values.*

Each skill is associated with several **talents** that represent a specific aspect of that skill. For example, the Stealth skill includes talents like Stalking and Submerge. Sooner or later, you will need talents because without the appropriate talent, you can still make skill checks, but you can only use **half** of your skill value. You can learn more about talents starting [here]().
You can purchase as many talents as you like, but if your skill value is below 5, it's usually wiser to simply increase the skill value itself. An inexperienced newcomer typically has between 3 and 6 talents.
The cost of a talent is **20 x advancement factor EP**. Rarely used talents are **discounted** and cost only **half**. Since every character is familiar with the customs of their own culture, they receive the corresponding talent for free.

*For Isna-Iti's best skill values, Judith naturally wants to acquire talents as well. For the Stealth skill, she chooses the Stalking talent and pays 60 EP (20 x advancement factor 3). The Craftsmanship skill should also have a talent, so Judith selects Woodworking. Woodworking is a discounted talent and costs 30 EP (10 x advancement factor 3). Judith acquires talents for the Impact Weapons, Pole Weapons, and Survival skills as well. Lastly, she receives the South Aventuria talent for the Customs skill as a gift, since Isna-Iti hails from that region. In total, Judith pays 240 EP for her talents.*

##### 4. Free Skills
Free skills encompass various rare crafts, languages, and writings. If you don't want your character to be illiterate, it is advisable to purchase at least one free skill.
Free skills are divided into **three levels**. With the first level, you are **inexperienced** in this free skill, with the second level, you are **experienced**, and with the third level, you are a **master** of this field. More details about free skills can be found [here]().

You can acquire these levels I/II/III for just **4/8/16 EP**, with the **preceding level** being a **prerequisite**. Naturally, every character is considered a master in their **native language** without having to spend EP for it.

*Judith is already quite satisfied with her character and only purchases a few free skills. She received Mohish III for free and additionally chooses Garethi I for 4 EP, allowing her to at least communicate rudimentarily with her fellow players. Since there is no Mohish script, Judith only purchases Dance II for 12 EP (4 for level I + 8 for level II).*

##### 5. Optional: Supernatural
If you want to play a character without supernatural abilities, you can safely skip this section. However, if you wish to create a spell caster, cleric, or even a pact-bound character, there are three points you need to consider:
- You need to acquire an **advantage** that grants your character their supernatural **energy**. For example, magic users need to purchase the advantage **Spell Caster** which grants them Astral Points (AsP).
- Additionally, you must acquire a **tradition advantage** that allows you to utilize your supernatural abilities. For example, a spell caster might acquire a magical tradition such as that of the **Druids**.
- Lastly, you will need to increase **supernatural skills** and **talents**. The latter is a collective term for **spells**, **liturgies**, and **invocations**. For example, a [Druid]() could increase their supernatural skill [Influence]() and unlock the supernatural talents (or spells) [Evil Eye]() and "Mastery of the [Animal Kingdom]().

| | Spell Caster | Cleric | Pact-bound |
| |:------------:|:------:|:----------:|
| Advantage | Spell Caster | Cleric | Pact-bound |
| Energy    | Astral Points (AsP) | Karma Points (KaP) | Favor Points (FaP) |
| Tradition | Magical | Karmal | Pact |
| sup. Talents | Spells | Liturgies | Invocations |

**Supernatural skills** and **talents** work similarly to **regular** skills and talents, with two exceptions: Firstly, you cannot use a spell, liturgy, or invocation until you have purchased it - not even at half the skill value. Secondly, the cost of a spell or liturgy does not depend on its skill, but rather ranges from **20**, **40**, **60**, **80**, or **120 experience points** based on its power and versatility. You can find all supernatural skills and their associated talents starting [here]().

*Since Judith still has 322 EP remaining, she decides to make Isna-Iti a Magic Diletante. She purchases the advantage [Spell Caster I]() (40 EP), which grants her 8 Astral Points, and the magical tradition [Magic Diletante]() (20 EP).<br> Among the supernatural skills, [Enhancement]() particularly appeals to her, as it allows her to strengthen herself. She increases the skill value of "Enhancement" to 5, which costs her a total of 45 EP (3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15) with a stepping factor of 3.<br> Finally, she acquires two spells for the skill "Enhancement": Adlerauge Luchsenohr (Eagle Eye Lynx Ear) for 20 EP and Axxeleratus for 40 EP. She plans to acquire more spells later on.*

The base value of your **supernatural energy** is obtained through the advantages Spell Caster, Geweiht (Blessed), or Paktierer (Pact Mage). If you already possess the corresponding advantage, you can still purchase **additional points** of this energy. Each point costs the **target value in EP**. The target value is determined solely by the additional points you purchase and is not influenced by the advantages.

*Since Judith only purchased the advantage Spell Caster I, Isna-Iti has 8 Astral Points. Judith considers this insufficient and acquires 5 additional Astral Points, costing her 15 EP (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5). Isna-Iti now has a total of 13 Astral Points. In total, Judith has spent 180 EP on her supernatural abilities.*

> **Generate comfortably with Sephrasto**<br>
> To make character generation even more convenient, you can use the character generation software called Sephrasto, which you can download for free from the DSA forum. Sephrasto calculates all EP costs and checks the prerequisites for advantages, allowing you to easily try out multiple variations of your character. Once you are satisfied with the result, you can transfer your character to the character sheet with just a click - and of course, save it to continue developing it after your first adventures.

#### The Finishing Touch

At this point, you may have some experience points left over, in which case you can simply go through points 1-5 again and distribute the remaining experience points. If you've run out of experience points, you will need to remove some advantages or lower attributes or skills.

*Fortunately, Judith still has 142 EP remaining. With that, she acquires additional advantages such as Quick I and II and Combat Reflexes for a total of 140 EP. With the remaining 2 EP, she has nothing else to spend on and decides to save them. Overall, Isna-Iti is a capable fighter who can enhance her abilities with magic and is skilled in the jungle. Judith is satisfied, although she eagerly awaits the first earned EP.*

Now is also the moment to check if you haven't **forgotten** anything:

- Each character is fluent in their **native language** and familiar with the **customs** of their homeland. You automatically receive the Free Skill for your native language at level III and the corresponding [Customs]() talent.
- **Other languages** and **scripts** need to be acquired as Free Skills. This also applies to the script of your native language if you don't want to play as an illiterate character.
- Nobles, warriors, swordmasters, and guild mages should possess the appropriate privileges, which require you to acquire the corresponding advantage (see [here]() for more on privileges).
- **Spellcasting characters** should be equipped with the Spellcaster advantage and a magical tradition. Most spellcasters also have their ritual object (e.g., a wand or familiar) already bound to them.
- **Devout** characters should have the [Devout]() advantage and a karmic tradition. Additionally, they likely possess knowledge of the Twelve Blessings.

### Step 4: Luck and Money

Now, all that's left for you to become a complete adventurer is a little bit of luck and the right equipment. You receive 4 Fate Points and a starting capital of 32 ducats, which you can use to purchase your equipment. Any remaining money you have at the start of the game can be carried with you, whether it's in the form of coins, gemstones, promissory notes, or trade goods.

> **Where can I find price lists?**<br>
> Ilaris does not provide its own price lists for Aventurian goods. You can refer to the supplement to the Game Master Screen (DSA 4.1) or the Core Rulebook (DSA 5) for equipment prices.

For some characters, the starting capital of 32 ducats may be too low, such as if you want to play a knight with shining plate armor and a horse. For others, it may be too high, as an escaped mine slave wouldn't have equipment worth 32 ducats. In such cases, you can adjust the starting capital up or down. Wealthy [very wealthy] characters start with 128 [256] ducats but only have 2 [0] Fate Points (see [here]()). Poor [very poor] characters can only spend 16 [4] ducats at the beginning but start the game with 5 [6] Fate Points. You cannot regain Fate Points above the maximum (usually 4 Fate Points).

*Judith purchases a spear for 3 ducats, an axe for 2 ducats, and light armor, which her game master determines to be worth 5 ducats. In addition, she buys some primitive tools and containers, estimating their cost at 3 ducats. Her total expenses amount to 13 ducats.<br> Judith thinks it would be strange if Isna-Iti were to walk around with numerous valuables. Therefore, she decides to have Isna-Iti start the game as poor. She receives 5 Fate Points and 3 ducats (16 - 13) in the form of some small black opals.*

**Now, you're ready to embark on your adventure!**

## Aspects

Aspects describe the strengths and weaknesses of your character, their past, goals, and worldview. They are also the primary means of gaining **Fate Points**.

### Fate Points

Your character can normally possess up to 4 Fate Points, which can be used in three ways:

1. **Stroke of Luck**: You can spend a Fate Point to gain an additional die for the next test. Instead of rolling with three dice, you roll with four, and the second-highest result counts. Instead of rolling with one die, you roll with two, and the highest result counts.
2. **Just a Scratch**: Immediately after suffering wounds, you can spend a Fate Point to halve the wounds you just received. This is an exception where rounding down is used.
3. **Cheating Death**: You can spend two Fate Points to cheat death for your character. To do so, you must propose a plausible suggestion to your game master on how your character survives the deadly situation. However, cheating death does not leave your character unscathed. Instead, they may survive a normally fatal fall with severe injuries or be mistaken for dead by enemies and looted.

However, Fate Points only fully unleash their power when combined with your **aspects**.

### Invoking Aspects
You can invoke aspects to give your character an advantage. If one of your aspects aligns with your intention, you can use fate points more effectively: Firstly, you gain even **two** (instead of one) additional dice for a **stroke of luck**. Secondly, you can **reroll** a skill test for one fate point. The Game Master has the right to veto these options.

*As Valeria stormed through the mercenary market, a crossbow bolt whizzed past her. A night wanderer in front of her fell to the ground with a gurgling sound. Valeria leaped over him and plunged into the maze of alleys. During the subsequent Stealth test, Christiane used Valeria's aspect "A Child of the City" to gain two additional dice for her next Stealth test through a stroke of luck. From her roll of 2, 3, 13, 17, 19, the 17 is considered. The test succeeds, and Valeria disappears unseen into a foul-smelling alley.*

### Compelling Aspects
Aspects also represent the weaknesses and quirks of your character and can be compelled to create interesting and challenging situations. In return, you receive a fate point, unless you already have the maximum number of fate points. Compelling aspects can be used in three ways:

1. **Initiated by the Game Master**: The Game Master offers to compel one of your aspects. If you accept, they can introduce a complication or dilemma that your character must face. In return, you receive a fate point. You can also decline the compelling of an aspect by spending one of your fate points. If you don't have any fate points, you cannot decline.
2. **Initiated by you**: You propose a compelling action or decision based on one of your aspects to the Game Master. If the Game Master agrees, they can introduce a challenging situation or obstacle that aligns with the aspect. In return, you receive a fate point. Taking initiative in compelling aspects is encouraged and rewarded!
3. **Organic to the story**: Sometimes, by naturally playing out your aspects, you create compelling situations without explicitly thinking about fate points. In such cases, the Game Master may award you a fate point retroactively for the compelling nature of the situation.

*Finally, Valeria has made it to the surrounding plantations and she sets out on her way to the country villa of a loyal friend. The Game Master offers Christiane a fate point to invoke the aspect "A Child of the City" Christiane accepts the offer, and Valeria becomes hopelessly lost in the thickets.*

If you refuse to invoke an aspect in a truly critical situation, the Game Master may **increase the stakes**. Instead of receiving one fate point, you now receive two if you allow the aspect to be compelled.
