# Characters
*Valeria had always loved the gardens, far away from the hustle and the stench of the city below, and the boredom in the marble villas. Slowly, the silence brought calmness to her racing thoughts as she stumbled. She felt a gust of air as the bolt grazed her left ear and embedded itself into the pavilion in front of her. This time, she didn't turn around but ran. She pushed aside a palm leaf, leaped over an intricately designed watercourse, and landed on the peacock shelter. Hopefully, the assassin hadn't loaded another crossbow! She grabbed the top edge of the garden wall, pulled herself up, and lowered herself onto the other side onto the street. The guards rushed towards her from the entrance gate, so they were bought off too! While her pursuer scaled the wall almost silently, she made a sharp turn and stormed down the street.*

At the center of your adventures are the player characters, who shape the shared story with their strengths and weaknesses.

You can choose your player character either from our collection of pre-made archetypes (within [Sephrasto](https://github.com/Aeolitus/Sephrasto)) and start playing right away, or you can generate a character according to your own vision. For the latter option, you'll find a four-step guide in the first part of this chapter, illustrated with an example character generation.

Throughout the process, you'll come across references to later parts of the chapter, where you'll find all the unique characteristics, skills, and advantages that make your character truly special. The background section describes the character's traits and status, while the attributes, skills, and advantages cover the character's values.

Now you can get started - the adventure awaits!

## Generation
Here you will learn how to generate your character - and how to further develop them later on, as in Ilaris there is no distinction between character generation and later advancement.

It all starts with an idea: What kind of character do you want to play? A shining hero, a dark villain, or something in between? Do you want them to excel in combat, be able to cast spells or liturgies, or rely on their silver tongue? Have they lived a life of privilege or struggled to make ends meet? If you're unsure, you can also consult with your fellow players - they might be able to assist you.

*Judith wants to play a character knowledgeable about nature, capable of defending themselves but lacking understanding of the laws of civilization. As for their origin, she is initially unsure, but since the group is going to experience adventures in South Aventuria, she decides to create a tribal warrior of the Mohas. Her character will be named Isna-Iti.*

### Step 1: Choosing Aspects
Aspects describe the strengths and weaknesses of your character, their background, education, and worldview. They shape the stories you will experience and are at the beginning of every character generation process.

At the start of the game, you should choose around **four aspects**. These aspects should include both strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, they should not be too specific or too general. You can find more tips on choosing your aspects and some examples [here]().

*For Judith's tribal warrior, she wants her to be superstitious but also particularly empathetic. Therefore, she chooses the aspect "I hear the whispers of the Nipakau..." Additionally, Isna-Iti gets the aspect "Tools? I can manage without them" and "Hello, Queen." After her initial sessions, Judith plans to add more aspects to give Isna-Iti even more depth.*

#### Developing Aspects
Dangers and obstacles, successes and encounters will shape and change your character. That's why your aspects will also evolve. After an adventure, you can, in consultation with the Game Master, remove or modify aspects. For example, the aspect "In service of the Ban Ray" could change to "Disgracefully discharged Ban Ray member." If your character has fewer than eight aspects, you can also add aspects in consultation with the Game Master. Such changes reflect profound transformations of your character and should be rare.

### Step 2: Choose Status
The status determines whether your character has dined on quail eggs in their previous life or has just escaped from inhumane slave labor in a mine. The status is divided into five levels, and you must choose one: **Elite**, **Upper Class**, **Middle Class**, **Lower Class**, and **Scum**. This decision primarily affects your character's background rather than their values, so choose the status that aligns with your character concept! More details [here]().

*For the forest people, status doesn't play a significant role, but in the civilized world, Isna-Iti wouldn't enjoy much prestige. Therefore, Judith chooses the status of Lower Class.*

#### Changing Status
Of course, during the course of your adventurer's life, your character's status can also change. They could be ennobled or become wealthy through valuable loot, thereby **improving their status**. Conversely, their actions could tarnish their reputation or they could lose their wealth or even their freedom, resulting in a **decrease in status**. Like aspects, status should change relatively slowly.

### Step 3: Distributing Points
Experience Points (EP) are the currency with which you develop the values of your character, enabling them to overcome increasingly greater challenges.

#### How many experience points do I have?
Before the generation process, you should collectively decide how powerful you want your characters to be at the start of the game. Choose an appropriate experience level from the table below, and then assign yourself the corresponding experience points as your starting capital. For beginners, we recommend starting with inexperienced novices and gradually developing the characters from there.

|Classification of Experience Points|^ |
|:----------------------:|:----------:|
| Inexperienced Novice    | 3000 EP        |
| Promising Young Hero     | 3000 EP      | 
| Competent Adventurer        | 4000 EP      | 
| Respected Veteran       | 6000 EP      |
| Famous Hero       | 8000 EP      |

*The players in Judith's group want to experience the full development from ordinary adventurers to exceptional heroes. Therefore, they decide to start with inexperienced newcomers, each having 2000 EP.*

Additional experience points are awarded by the Game Master as rewards for successfully completing adventures or, in the case of very long adventures, after completing a section of the adventure. As a guideline, 20-40 experience points are typically awarded for a game session of about four hours. The actual amount of experience points received does not depend on the level of success achieved. For example, if the characters' hometown was just burned down, the players should not be further penalized by deducting experience points.

The accumulated experience points form a balance that you can save for later use, such as purchasing an expensive advantage. Any remaining experience points never expire. However, you cannot go into negative balance; you cannot "borrow" the missing 2 experience points for an advantage. How you spend the accumulated experience points is entirely up to you.

#### Where do I start?
With experience points, you can purchase [attributes](), [skill values](), and [advantages]() - we will introduce all these options briefly in the following sections. To help you stay organized, we recommend the following order:

1. First, choose the advantages that your character absolutely should have. Many of these advantages require specific attributes.
2. Increase the attributes that you need for your desired advantages. Allocate the remaining points to the other attributes, following your intuition, until you have used up a little more than half of your experience points - spellcasters and clerics use slightly less than half.
3. Distribute the remaining experience points among skill values, talents, free skills, and potentially supernatural abilities. Experiment with different options to see what you like best!

> **What do experience points represent?**
> EP are a rough measure of your character's abilities and a reward for you to improve your character.
> They cannot and should not simulate the real learning of an adventurer. Therefore, there are no EP for months of studying in libraries, and the costs of all abilities are based on their usefulness, not on how difficult they are to learn.
>**Experience points for Non-Player Characters?**
> Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in Ilaris follow the same character rules as player characters, meaning they need to fulfill the requirements of advantages, for example.
> However, in most cases, it will be sufficient to estimate the values of NPCs based on their intended role in the game world. If a special NPC requires generation, the Game Master determines how many EP the NPC receives: A squire of a player knight may only need 2000 EP, while a warlord in the Wilderlands surely deserves 6000 EP.
>**Optional: Simulationist Character Generation**
>The character system of Ilaris aims to create equally valuable characters who can each contribute their strengths to the game and shine in the spotlight
>However, this does not necessarily reflect the reality of Aventuria. In Aventuria, training often depends on time and money, so knights, guild mages, dwarves, and others receive excellent education in many areas, while a beggar can only acquire a few things through experience. Simulationist character generation takes this into account.
>Characters with excellent education, such as warriors, knights, guild mages, elves, many dwarves, many initiates, or students of special mentors, receive 200-400 EP more, which they can primarily use to acquire additional skills and (supernatural) talents. On the other hand, characters disadvantaged by fate start with a starting capital 200 EP lower.
>**Optional: Genre-Specific Experience Points**
> EP serve as motivation for players to engage in adventures. However, in thematic groups, EP can also reward other genre-specific actions.
>1. The schemers at the imperial court of the Middle Kingdom could receive 20 bonus EP if they maneuver an ally into a position of influence or weave a particularly well-thought-out intrigue—even if they ultimately fail.
>2. In a swashbuckling game, a spectacular duel on a rooftop could be rewarded with 10 bonus EP.
>This can provide an additional incentive to engage in genre-specific behavior. We recommend discussing such rewards in advance and always giving the bonus EP to all players.
