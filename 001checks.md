# Checks
*Valeria tried in vain to concentrate on her aunt's words. She didn't give a damn who was left bleeding in the arena again, but of course she couldn't say that.
The musician's kablas flute whistled shrilly, which only made her headache worse. She mumbled an apology and stood up. Now a deep puff Marbo's breath! 
But she did not want to test her luck now that she had finally entered the inner circle of grandees.
Instead, she called for the cupbearer.*

Dice provide excitement in role play. They will bring carefully developed plans to collapse, turn almost
lost battles in your favour and show whether you have made wise decisions. In this chapter you will learn how to use the dice in checks.

Ilaris uses a fast and simple test roll in which you have to surpass a difficulty by combining your dice roll with your value. 
You can easily adjust this roll to represent different environments, varying degrees of luck, and the cooperation within your group.

Next, we introduce the different types of tests: 
In **open tests**, you try to achieve a fixed difficulty, while in **comparative tests**, you compete against an opponent.
On the other hand, **extended tests** consist of multiple open or comparative tests and are primarily used in longer scenes.

## The Check
Checks are conducted based on the following basic principle:

1. Roll three twenty-sided dice (**3d20**). The die with the middle result is the one that counts.
2. Add the **check value** (**CV**, see below), as well as any modifiers that make the check more difficult or easier. The result is the **success value** (**SV**).
3. If the success value is equal to or higher than the **difficulty**, the check succeeds.

*Slowly, Valeria raises her goblet to her lips and inhales the scent of the wine, as the game master requests a Vigilance check with a difficulty of 20. 
Valeria's player, Christiane, rolls 14, 3, 14. Thus, the 14 is considered, and together with Valeria's check value of 11, it yields a success value of 25 (14 + 11).
This is well above the required difficulty. A metallic smell fills Valeria's nostrils - poison!*

The **check value** is twice the **attribute value** for [attribute checks]() and the sum of the **base value** and **skill value** for [skill checks]().
Greenhorns have a check value of 2, legendary heroes of 22, and most characters fall somewhere in between.

### Modifiers
Negative modifiers decrease your success value and are therefore indicated with a minus sign. They arise from unfavorable circumstances such as darkness or unstable ground.
Conversely, positive modifiers increase your success value due to positive circumstances and are noted with a plus sign. All specified modifiers are divided into **four levels** and are always ±2, ±4, ±8, ±16. 
Advantages, spells, or liturgies can modify these levels. For example, the Advantage [Adapted I (Darkness)]() reduces negative modifiers caused by darkness by one level, for instance, from -8 to -4.
Often, you can voluntarily make the check more difficult to achieve an additional effect.
For many cases, such as melee attacks against multiple opponents, longer-lasting spells, or more powerful liturgies, you can find the required difficulties and their effects in the respective chapters of this rulebook.
However, the most important voluntary negative modifier is **High Quality**.
With it, you can forge sharper swords, brew deadlier poisons, or intimidate your opponents more strongly.
Each High Quality increases the difficulty of your test by -4. The exact effects of High Quality can be found in the corresponding activity descriptions.

### Luck and Environment
In most checks, the skill of the participants is the main factor.
In arm wrestling, for example, the stronger individual will almost always win, and a trained athlete will reach the finish line faster.
The 3d20 test reflects this. However, in some tests, **luck** or the **environment** plays a significant role. 
Even the best swordsman can be blinded by the sun, and a supposed dead-end in a pursuit can turn out to be a shortcut.
In such cases, the test is performed with only **1d20**, indicated by the **Roman numeral (I)** (1). These types of checks are most commonly encountered in combat or other high-stress situations.

> **Ein oder drei Würfel?**
> Für den Start ein paar Vorschläge: Zauber, Liturgien und Magieresistenz würfelst du mit 3W20 – alle anderen Proben in Kämpfen, Rededuellen oder Verfolgungsjagden mit 1W20. Außerhalb solcher Stresssituationen verwendest du immer 3W20.

### Triumph and Fumble
If your check succeeds and the die being evaluated shows a 20, you have achieved a triumph, and your character accomplishes an extraordinary, even outstanding, success.
Conversely, if a check fails and the die shows a 1, it signifies a fumble - your character has ended up in an unpleasant or even life-threatening situation.

*Someone wants me dead! Valeria pushes past two matronly grand dames exchanging false compliments.
Just get out! A Stealth check will determine how inconspicuous Valeria is.
Christiane rolls 1, 17, 1, with the 1 being evaluated, and she fails to meet the required difficulty - a fumble.
As she looks around for pursuers, Valeria accidentally bumps into a household slave. A clay jar shatters noisily on the floor, and all eyes turn to Valeria.*

Fumbles only occur in failed checks. So, if you achieve the required difficulty with an evaluated roll of 1, you succeed.
Such "guaranteed" checks, therefore, do not need to be rolled. Conversely, triumphs only occur in successful checks. Even if you roll a 20, it does not turn a failure into a success.

### Collaboration
In some tasks, it is beneficial for multiple characters to **collaborate**. The game master decides how many characters can provide assistance and the extent of their **influence**.
Helpers can roll a check that is 4 points easier to assist the main character's crucial check by +2 (minor influence), +4 (major influence), or rarely even +8 (enormous influence) per helper.
If a helper fails their test, the crucial check is instead hindered by -2. 

*"Too much... wine!" she exclaims, staggering back a few steps, hoping the guests would quickly lose interest in a drunkard.
In the meantime, the head butler announces, "If the esteemed guests would now turn their attention to the dancing Ice Princess."
Christiane now has to make a Persuasion check (16), with the head butler acting as a helper with major influence. His successful Rhetoric check (12) eases Valeria's check by +4.
Valeria's check also succeeds, and the guests' attention shifts to the dancing Ice Princess.*

### Group Checks
Group checks are used in two cases. First, when the success of an individual character is enough to advance the entire group, such as when breaking down a door. 
Second, when even a single failure leads to a collective failure, such as when multiple hunters are trying to sneak up on their prey.
In a group check, **one player makes a check**, and the result is binding for the entire group. If the brawny Ferkina fails to break down the door, the scrawny magician certainly won't stand a chance.
When success is sufficient, the group can choose the player who will make the check. However, if a failure jeopardizes the entire group, the player with the lowest skill value always makes the check. 
Of course, **Collaboration** is also beneficial in many group checks, such as when breaking open a door together or when a hunter warns the clumsy rover about dry twigs on the ground.

## Kinds Of Checks

### Transparent Checks
Most tests are transparent checks, where the game master determines the difficulty of the test. Experienced game masters can do this intuitively, but until then, you can refer to the following table.
On the left, you determine how challenging you want the check to be, and the numbers in parentheses indicate the success chance. On the top, you can categorize the experience level of the characters.

*In the previous situation, the game master determined the difficulty of the test using the table. 
She decides that the test is challenging for an inexperienced character (PW 6) and sets the difficulty to 16. Fortunately, Valeria is experienced in social matters (PW 10), making the test only average for her.*

|                      | clueless | inexperienced | seasoned | experienced | famous | legendary |
|----------------------|----------|---------------|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| commonplace (99%)    | 4        | 8             | 12       | 16          | 20     | 24        |
| ordinary (84%)       | 8        | 12            | 16       | 20          | 24     | 28        |
| simple (72%)         | 10       | 14            | 18       | 22          | 26     | 30        |
| challenging (57%)    | 12       | 16            | 20       | 24          | 28     | 32        |
| difficult (43%)      | 14       | 18            | 22       | 26          | 30     | 34        |
| very difficult (28%) | 16       | 20            | 24       | 28          | 32     | 36        |
| unrealistic (16%)    | 18       | 22            | 26       | 30          | 34     | 38        |
| spectacular (1%)     | 22       | 26            | 30       | 34          | 38     | 42        |

Just to clarify: The same action always requires the same test difficulty! 
However, this difficulty represents a different challenge for different characters, as you can see in the table.
For example, forging a sword (difficulty 16) is a challenging task for an inexperienced apprentice (PW 6). On the other hand, an experienced blacksmith (PW 14) can accomplish the same task effortlessly.
